/**
In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

/**

Let NN be the length of order, and MM be the total number of characters in words.

Time complexity : O(M)O(M).

Storing the letter-order relation of each letter takes O(N)O(N) time. For the nested for-loops, we examine each pair of words in the outer-loop and for the inner loop, we check each letter in the current word. Therefore, we will iterate over all of letters in words.

Taking both into consideration, the time complexity is O(M + N)O(M+N). However, we know that NN is fixed as 2626. Therefore, the time complexity is O(M)O(M).

Space complexity : O(1)O(1). The only extra data structure we use is the hashmap/array that serves to store the letter-order relations for each word in order. Because the length of order is fixed as 2626, this approach achieves constant space complexity.
